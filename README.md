# Sell This, Not That!

Welcome! This was my submission to the 2020 COMAP Math Modeling competition. I entered the competition representing Trinity University along with my two teammates Alex Motter and Kit (Christopher) Alderson.

## The Purpose

We had been "hired" by Sunshine Company to identify key patterns, relationships, measures, and parameters in Amazon customer reviews across three products: Microwave Ovens, Baby Pacifiers, and Hair Dryers. The requirements were as follows:

- Analyze the product data sets to identify, describe, and support with mathematical evidence, meaningful quantitative and/or qualitative patterns, relationships, measures, and parameters within and between star ratings, reviews, and helpfulness ratings that will help Sunshine Company succeed in their three new online marketplace product offerings.

- Use your analysis to address the following specific questions and requests from the Sunshine Company Marketing Director:
   - Identify data measures based on ratings and reviews that are most informative for Sunshine Company to track, once their three products are placed on sale in the online marketplace.
   - Identify and discuss time-based measures and patterns within each data set that might suggest that a product's reputation is increasing or decreasing in the online marketplace.
   - Determine combinations of text-based measure(s) and ratings-based measures that best indicate a potentially successful or failing product.
   - Do specific star ratings incite more reviews? For example, are customers more likely to write some type of review after seeing a series of low star ratings?
   - Are specific quality descriptors of text-based reviews such as 'enthusiastic', 'disappointed', and others, strongly associated with rating levels?
   
## Deliverable

Our deliverable above consists of:
- A summary sheet
- A letter to the company
- Our formal solution written in LaTeX
- A data dictionary
- Generalized R code to see what we developed (and run if you really wanted to!)
